            <h1>A Short History of the Clan of Jonyari</h1>
            <p>Excerpts from the oral archives of the clan history as narrated by key informants, more especially Azaria Wolyan and others.</p>
            <p>First edition 2012 - Written and compiled by: Joseph L. Lupai</p>

            <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
            <p>This short history of the clan of Jonyari is purposely narrated and written for the consumption and establishment of historical information bank for the present and future generations of the clan of Jonyari. More often than not, the majority of the clan members suffers from inadequacy or even absolute lack of knowledge about their own history, yet the key informants from whom such invaluable historical information and knowledge source are becoming ever increasingly scarce as time ticked away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the inadequacy of such historical knowledge and information has made many to lose significantly their historical background, organization, cultural values and practices. Further, the informational inadequacy has an enormous impact and challenge in the functional public responsibility and representation of the interest of the clan whenever called for.</p>
            <p>The objective of this documentation is to enhance the knowledge, information base and functional responsibilities of those with stake in the clan.</p>
            <p>Further, I wish to concur with any interested reader that there are apparently some information deficiencies and gaps in the document as you read through. It has surely not offered in-depth analysis and holistic historical background of the clan, hence the need to further research on the subject matter. However, the availability of such a document has laid a benchmark on which to build a broader picture of the historical reality of the clan. I therefore want to take this opportunity to appeal to those who may have some knowledge or any other valuable information or data pertinent to the history of the clan to come forward and contribute in filling the deficiencies left by the document to make it more comprehensive and suitable to all readers.</p>
            <p>My sincere thanks and appreciation go to those who organized the event of the return of our great grandfather Lupai home from uncles which provided incredible insights into the clan history.</p>
            <p>I am also indebted to the key informants, more especially elder Azaria Wolyan Morris Murye Lupai for the invaluable knowledge, information and clarifications without which such a documentation wouldn't otherwise be achieved.</p>

            <h2>Clan History</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>What is Jonyari?</summary>
                <p>Jonyari is a sub-clan of the descendants of Koboji the son of Dabe and his inherited wife Landu. It is a splinter but remained an integral sub-clan of Malari through which it is further anchored the main clan of Yibur.</p>
                <p>Without going through the intricate, the clan of Yibur is one of the great clans of the people of Gaderu Boma, Kajo-Keji County-Central Equatoria state. It is comprised of three sub-clans as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nyayinga sub-clan that is traceable to the family of Kabur Lobiji ancestry</li>
                    <li>Boyika sub-clan that is represent the family of Potot/Loyonga/piding lineage</li>
                    <li>Malari sub-clan that is traceable to Wori and Dabe ancestry.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The people of the clan of Yibur are Kuku by tribe who originated from the clans of Madi tribes and migrated for various reasons and settle at the present Gaderu during the era of population movements.</p>
                <p>The land of Yibur is not clearly defined but the Yibur variously occupy the Toroko hills and it peripheries. To establish the territorial boundaries of the land of Yibur requires further research.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Who are the Jonyari?</summary>
                <p>This question is seeming obvious and innocent, yet significant to highlight for the purpose of clarity and at the same time to rid out misconceptions about Jonyari.</p>
                <p>The Jonyari are not only the family of Lupai Losuku and his grandsons and granddaughters as it often seemed to imply. The Jonyari are variously the ancestry or lineage of Koboji where the clan of Jonyari came to exist, otherwise there was nothing known as Jonyari before Koboji.</p>
                <p>Further, the Jonyari are the descendants of Dabe who hailed from the clan of Malari. The Jonyari broke out from there and became known as Jonyari. Yes, Dabe was our biological grandparent; but in the real sense of the traditional interpretation, the Jonyari are the descendants of his late brother from whose bride wealth he bore us after inheriting his wife Landu.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Split of Malari into the Main Stream Malari and Jonyari</summary>
                <p>Initially the Malari sub-clan comprised of the families of three great parents who were brothers. These were Wori as an elder brother, Dabe and a third younger brother whose name remained unknown to date.</p>
                <p>The three grew up together and each got married, unfortunately the younger brother died in incomprehensible circumstances. It wasn't clear whether or not he had a child by the time he died, otherwise there isn't any reference to his children.</p>
                <p>Wori the elder brother became very unhappy and complacent about the death of their brother. Unfortunately without substantially gathering evidential facts about the cause of the death; he did not only suspect the widow of the deceased for complicity in the death, but he even went further to demand investigation and eventual justice. Cde Dabe was opposed to such unpopular and unfounded views and challenged the allegations but he didn't have sufficient leverage over the stance taken by Cde Wori.</p>
                <p>In this continued pursue for justice and ascertain his suspicion and therefore claims; Cde Wori deemed it fit to consult with the witch doctors an approach which unfortunately was very unrealistic and counter-productive at the same time. Being an elder son, he managed not only to manipulate but even mobilized popular opinion of the clan members and succeeded to rally support over the same.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Findings of the Consultation with the Witch Doctors</summary>
                <p>Indeed a consultation with the witch doctors was done as usual, the resultant findings were that the person behind the death under scrutiny was within the clan. The witch doctor provided the consulters with some package of tips, tasks and instructions on what should be done to predict or know the potential killer.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Tips, Tasks and Instructions</summary>
                <p>The witch doctor asked the clan to perform the under listed processes and tasks accordingly. This will usher into finding out the suspect behind the death or killing. The following were what must be performed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Call for a clan gathering, briefing and debrief members accordingly</li>
                    <li>Avail some chicken</li>
                    <li>Arrange the clan members to sit in a panel of round table (circular form)</li>
                    <li>Tie the chicken by the leg with relatively long loose rope and peg it to the middle of the panel</li>
                    <li>Slaughter the chicken so quickly probably with a sharp knife and allow the chicken to throw itself here and there as it struggle to finally die</li>
                    <li>When the chicken finally died in a position directly pointing or at least nearer to someone, then that person is assumed responsible for such a death.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Conclusion of the Exercise</summary>
                <p>After performing the exercise according to the instructions of the witch doctor, the chicken coincidently died very close or pointing at the direction of Landu, the widow of the deceased. The obvious conclusion was that the poor widow was responsible for the death of their brother.</p>
                <p>By this revolution, the clan members were convinced beyond any reasonable doubts that this woman indeed killed their brother. Hence a clan summary execution committee was constituted to analyze the implication of any action they wished to undertake thereof. It was against this backdrop that a verdict was passed by consensus that the poor woman deserved the death penalty.</p>
                <p>Dabe was not happy and did not mince his words in opposition to the verdict which according to him was idiotic and merely an act of witch hunt simply employed to discredit the poor widow. His resentment was on basis that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pursue of the justice was just an act of witch hunt on the part of Wori</li>
                    <li>He did not want blood of other people else to pour in their family due to the death of their brother</li>
                    <li>He schemed to eventually inherit this widow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But in spite of Dabe's resentment and opposition, the clan member went ahead to implement the verdict. Dabe on his part had no option but only to keep Mum (Landu) alive as the clan members gathered on the chosen day and time to march to the woman's house to kill her. On the way, they stopped to take some showers in one of the streams proximate to the women's house. Dabe got the opportunity to demonstrate his resentment and sneaked ahead to alert the woman. He found her doing some knitting under one of the big granaries. He begged the woman to run away for her safety to their home or at least hide nearby because the people were coming to kill her. She refused saying “I prefer to be killed and die after my husband because I didn't kill him. I loved my husband and used to prepare food to my loved one with these my bear hands. If I am to die or be killed because I caused his death, then so be it”.</p>
                <p>In spite of her defiance, Dabe after an intense persuasion and plea succeeded at the end to convince her and whisked the woman into hiding nearby. Now having succeeded to abort the assassination scheme or attempted; and in anticipation of any emotional reaction from the clan members, Dabe decided to rush home and gathered his sheath (tradition weapons) in readiness for any unforeseen eventualities.</p>
                <p>When the clan members reached the woman's house after the shower; she was nowhere to be seen. The killing squad were utterly amazed at what happened because there were traces of fresh human activities at the compound which suggested that she was around few minutes ago. Wori stared around and lamented, when we took showers, we were not all around, one of us (Dabe) went missing. This person is responsible for what had happened (meaning the disappearance of the woman). Deeply outraged, Wori tried to engineer the clan members into attacking Dabe in his well-fortified premises but they refused saying “we are not prepared once again to spill the blood of any of our own”.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Heightened Animosity</summary>
                <p>The differences between the two brothers, Wori and Dabe certainly intensified time by time partly because of the aborted assassination scheme but also because Dabe's secret scheme to inherit the widow succeeded. Wori resorted to employing his usual counter-productive approaches of witch crafting. He consulted the witch doctors and was advised this time to kill a Gecko i.e. the red headed lizard and put it inside the big granary where the house hold consumables of the inherited wife of Dabe were kept. When the woman later went to get some food stuffs, she found the rotting gecko. She did not hesitate but reported the matter to her husband.</p>
                <p>Dabe suspected his brother Wori for the action(s) and counteracted by reciprocate actions. These counter reciprocate actions continued in tit for tat fashion until it culminated coincidently in the death of Wori's wife. This further heightened the animosity of these brothers. Wori became weary and pretty witty; he very much exploited the incident of the death of his wife as an opportunity and means to destroy his brother. He did so by falsely alleging to his relative in-laws that Dabe was responsible for the death of their daughter.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Demise of Dabe</summary>
                <p>The in-laws of Wori were utterly outraged by the death of their daughter and further by the revelation that Dabe was solely behind her death; the relatives of the deceased (Wori's late wife) then vowed to revenge. They set up a clandestine assassination scheme in which they routinely conducted surveillance and night tracking of Dabe's compound.</p>
                <p>Dabe sensed soonest some suspicious night movements at his backyard and strategize counter precautionary measures. He did so by avoiding coming out at night for fear of being attacked. But it was not long before Dabe became increasingly frustrated with this state of affairs and threatened to end the stalemate.</p>
                <p>On one night he became headedly defiant and refused to urinate inside the room as usual. He lamented to his inherited wife “this time I must urinate outside the room; come what may”. Having said that, he asked his wife Landu to get out there and rake the situation to ensure some safety. She did and did not observe any potential threat or any enemy movement. Dabe then came out and urinated safely and exclaimed “oh yah, what a nice thing to urinate in the open”. After finishing, he walked back and as he entered the room, he was fiercely shot with an arrow on the buttocks by his highly concealed enemies. He fell into the room and cried “I am finished”. He however managed to fight back and killed three of his attackers instantly.</p>
                <p>The injury became septic because there were no facilitates to remove the arrow and he did not only fall bed ridden but even eventually died.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Last Words of Dabe</summary>
                <p>When Dabe was about to die, he spoke to his inherited wife Landu and these were the words of the dying man: I know I am going to die, and if I do so, please let them (his next of kin, in this case his relatives) use or destroy every things in my possession (wealth and properties) except that milking cow code named Songo. You fulfil the traditional obligation of mourning my death and thereafter; you go to your relatives (family) at Liwolo with this my baby.</p>
                <p>When the time is set for you to go, collect the baby and as you walk away, call the name of the cow I have told you. This cow will listen to your call and break loose its rope and follow wherever you go. By the help of the cow milk, this child will grow up into a man and become the head of this clan.</p>
                <p>Landu did everything as instructed and went to their family with the baby. The child grew up into a man with his uncles, got married, settled and multiplied. While there, the uncles gave him a piece of land and he called it Yibur after the name of the main clan. That piece of land to date is traditionally defined as the legitimate resource of the grandchildren of Jonyari. In the contemporary world, land is a resource and potential source of livelihood security; hence it is of great significance for the Jonyari to follow up the issues of that land.</p>
                <p>Koboji decided to defined and shape his own identity and destiny by setting up his own clan and called it Jonyari. This was how the name Jonyari came into being and since then, we became known as Jonyari rather than Malari which was initially our origination.</p>
                <p>Apparently when Dabe died, his inherited wife Landu had only one child (Koboji) who had survive with a family and kids as emphasized by the narration of the history, however there were other two brothers of Koboji (Lopia and one other his name unknown) and their history remained bleak because there were no further accounts about them and their descendants.</p>
                <p>Koboji is the second greatest grandparents in the hierarchy of our known grandparents.</p>
                <p>Basically Dabe was married to a legitimate wife whose name was unknown. She had given birth to children but all were baby girls. When Dabe inherited Landu and gave birth to a baby boy; she became unhappy and jealous and went to their family with all the children. The children did not come back and to date, their whereabouts remained unknown. This implied that the entire clan of Jonyari are the descendants of Landu the wife of the late younger brother whom Dabe inherited.</p>
                <p>This negates the legitimacy of some derogatory and abusive phrase such as the inherited “rutat” often used by some rogue and notorious elements within the clan to alienate others. Is it not time for these elements to desist from such phrases and put their application to rest?</p>
                <p>Another topical subject matter to research on is related to the exiled of our grandparent Koboji. Since Landu fled to their family in Liwolo with Koboji as a baby; did they or those after ever returned back? If not: what are the cultural/traditional implication? Did the Korsak then collected Lupai while under the patronage of Landu's relatives? Besides, were there some kind of reconciliations between the descendants of Wori and Dabe after things went bizarre?</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Profile of Lupai</summary>
                <p>Lupai was the son of Tongidyang, Tongidyang who was born by Koboji the Son of Dabe. He (Lupai) was one of great grandparents of Jonyari who had a very extensive oral history. It was not pretty clear why, when and where he was nick named Lupai which literally implied “the rejected one”, otherwise his family name was Lubadu. Further, nobody knew for sure who our grandparents were beyond or before Jonyari and Malari, but according to some oral history of our generational profiles, Lupai was ranked in the list of our known grandparents as the fourth.</p>
                <p>For reasons unknown, the clan of Jonyari went through difficult moments of misfortunes. In particular, the family of Tongidyang experienced the most terrible moments of tribulation and persistent deaths. In fact all the children of Tongidyang perished and Lupai was the only one who survived those misfortunes. Outraged with what happened and imagining the kind of life Lupai would otherwise experience living alone in the midst of the graves; the uncles of Lupai intervened by repatriating and hosting Lupai at Korsak.</p>
                <p>In our cultural practices, if ones sister is losing out children to death, the relatives of the woman or the uncles of the children reserves the right to take over the remaining children or child to nurture. It was against this backdrop that Lupai was taken over by his uncles the Korsak until the recent past when the Jonyari clan was last bailed out from the Korsak. All the generations who hailed from the ancestry of Lupai were perceived as staying under the arrangements of the Korsak/ uncle until the time they were bailed out or returned backed from the Korsak/uncles on 03rd Mar 2012.</p>
                <p>In the past, there were conflicting accounts about whether or not the Korsak took Lupai as a minor. The other side of this argument was negated by clarification from both sides during the occasion of the bail of Lupai. The fact of the matter was that Lupai was actually repatriated when he was not only matured but married. It was a whole family repatriation including granaries and other household properties.</p>

            <h2>Genealogy and Descendants</h2>
            <p>The descendants of Jonyari are traceable back into this line and context of history narration, starting from Malari sub-clan and down to Jonyari sub-clan.</p>
            <p>The first known grandparents of our ancestry in descending order were Wori, Dabe and a younger brother whose name was unknown. These brothers formed the sub-clan of Malari from which the sub-clan of Jonyari broke out.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>1st Known Generational Descendants of the Clan of Jonyari/Malari</summary>
                <h3>The Family and Grandchildren of Wori</h3>
                <p>The lineage of Wori remained sketchy because their oral history is very much scarce; but Rabuk Kabur Lobiji and grandchildren are continued descendants of that line of the family or clan.</p>
                <h3>The Family and Grandchildren of the Younger Brother Whose Name was Unknown</h3>
                <p>The younger brother married Landu from Liwolo and he perhaps died early enough before he could bear a child. This claim is justified because there was no further reference into the history of his descendants.</p>
                <h3>The Descendants of Dabe</h3>
                <p>Dabe married a legitimate wife (unknown name) and bore baby girls, but she left because she became jealous when Dabe inherited Landu the wife of his younger late brother and gave birth to a baby boy. Neither this woman nor the children did come back and their whereabouts remained unknown to date.</p>
                <p>As earlier mentioned Dabe inherited Landu the widow of his late brother and gave birth to Koboji, Lopia and one other son (name unknown). The history of these other two brothers remained bleak because there were no further accounts about them and their descendants.</p>
                <p>Dabe was the biological father of Koboji, Lopia and a certain son but culturally; these were the children of his late brother.</p>

Lutan also inherited from elsewhere, mother of Roba Lokuli, Roba Lokuli then married Marata the daughter of Gudi, she is popularly known by the name of Marata Wori Gudi and gave birth to Mojule and others.</p>
                <p>Note: Wori Kau did not have blood relation with the clan of Jonyari, he was rather a professional black smith (Tumunit) of Jonyari. That was where he acquired the rights to inherit the widow of Lo'du. The generation produced within such arrangements are equally Jonyari because they were produced within the bride wealth of Jonyari.</p>
                <p>Tongidyang: Married to his wife Suku from the clan of Korsak and fathered or gave birth to Dabe, Amunuki and Lupai (Lubadu) and there was no account about their sisters.</p>

                <summary>4th Known Generational Descendants of the Clan of Jonyari/Malari</summary>
                <h3>The Descendants of Dabe (Dabe De Junior)</h3>
                <p>Dabe got married to Doru from the clan of Romoggi-Liwolo and gave birth to Poni popularly known as Poni Na Dabe and Modi (died young). Dabe had only two kids with his first wife Doru and then he died. Lupai thereafter inherited Doru and gave birth to Abrama Mogga.</p>
                <p>Dabe also married to a second wife called Giye from the clan of Liekor from Liwolo and gave birth to Nikademo Logbong and Priscilla Baye the mother of Bismarck Bungit. These were born within the bride wealth of Dabe; hence they are traditionally legitimate children of Dabe and therefore are Jonyari.</p>
                <p>Abrama Mogga: Mogga was the ancestor of Yisaka Piso, Lea Suku, Timoteo Tongidyang, Ryembe, Gordon Yama Lo'du, Grace Talata, Joseph Yanga and Tola from the first wife legitimate wife Elisabeta Ropi.</p>
                <p>Cyrus Tongidyang sometimes called Khamis Laila, Suku also Called Zande, Joyce Kiden also known as Yanya and Henry Jenge from his second legitimated wife called Grace Juan the daughter of Boro from Dongoro.</p>
                <p>And Richard Taban also called Tongidyang, Sylvia Suku also called Dudu and Monday from his third legitimate wife Pilista Juru. But the later was separated by the Anyanya war and bore other children from elsewhere out of wedlock. Are these other children culturally Jonyari???</p>
                <h3>The Descendants of Amunuki and Brief History About Him</h3>
                <p>Amunuki was engaged to Gire the daughter of Buju from the clan of Leikor-Liwolo and he died before they actually wedded. By the time he died, the traditional marriage formalities were already accomplished including the payment of the bride wealth and the introductory process of the marriage. Gire had to remain at home with her parents after the unfortunate death of her loved one.</p>
                <p>Gire was known to be such a beautiful light skinned lady that was highly admired by man. It was not long before she was eloped by one the colonial master (Jaalia) who coincidentally were in the area at the time. During the colonial era, the masters can elope any girl they deemed suitable and the parents would do nothing about it.</p>
                <p>Gire was however recovered by the brother of Kiden the daughter of Maa. He went and diplomatically negotiated the release of his own sister Kiden who was also eloped by the same. In the process, he equally negotiated for the release of Gire in the deal because both of them hailed from the same geographical location i.e. Liwolo.</p>
                <p>According to the society's customary practices in the recent past, any woman whose bride wealth was already settled, she is defined as the wife of that person or family. On the basis of such interpretation of the customary practices, Gire was accounted from that moment as the legitimate wife of Jonyari. Aware of such traditional rights and mindful that this lady might actually be eloped to someone else again, the members of their family pressured Lupai to act and inherit the lady.</p>
                <p>While still fumbling about the way forward, the lady by coincidence developed some bad wounds. Her parents became more concerned and suspected her family of marriage for having bewitched or evil eyed their daughter. They quickly read the situation between the lines and acted by handing over Gire to the family of her late husband and so Cde Lupai inherit Gire as a wife of his late brother Amunuki.</p>
                <p>The death of Amunuki was reportedly inconceivable and mind juggling given the account of its cause. According to key informants; there were strong traditional beliefs in the past that when bridegroom howls or ululates/grief during his own marriage ceremony was a taboo and if the mother in-law reciprocates/response tantamount/equivalent to death. According to key informants that was what happened and caused the death of Amunuki.</p>
                <p>Amunuki was the ancestor to Ebele Kitenge sometimes called ‘Doko or Gubaji, Petero Koboji, Muja, Sarah Leong and Modong.</p>
                <p>Abele Kitenge: Kitenge was the father of Gamba, Stanley Roba, Nicolas Buju, Suku, Ijang, Kabudu, and Tongidyang sometimes called Dwoki from the first legitimate wife called Sokale.</p>
                <p>And Taban Abel also called Yamba, Suku sometimes called Suku Wiling-wiling, Makka, Yata, Kenyi John and Lo'du Bismarck from the second legitimated wife Yanya from the clan of Wandi.</p>
                <p>Petero Koboji: Petero Koboji was a father of Sokiri, Joselin Juan also called Wori Giye, Pita Na Petero, Ko'do, Buju, Tongidyang and Abate.</p>
                <h3>The Descendants of Lupai (Lubadu or Moron)</h3>
                <p>Lupai was engaged to Raele Adede (Wori Kajanyiri) from the clan of Kagiri in Bori- Kangapu ii Payam. When he (Lupai) became embroiled in inheritance of his brothers' wives; it became an issue of concern to the parents of Adede who thought their daughter might lose out. They read the situation between the lines and dispatched Adede to Lupai as wife.</p>
                <p>Traditionally, Adede is the first and legitimate wife of Lupai because the wives he inherited from his late brothers were referenced after their late husbands. Similarly, he was the biological parent of the resultant children from the inherited wives, yet the tradition would regard him only as an environmental parent.</p>
                <p>Adede then gave birth to Wani commonly known as Bungu, Purumena Logborong also called Tutuan, Rebecca Juan, Morris Murye and Elisabeta Yari.</p>
                <p>Wani Bungu: Bungu married Tabita Yobu as his first legitimate wife and then gave birth to Wilson Lodiong, Sartiele Yama Lo'du, Charity Suku, and Kiryembe.</p>
                <p>Bungu from his second legitimate wife Kaku gave birth to William Wolyan, Escesles Nnyarsuk, and Joy Yine. There were others born out of wedlock.</p>
                <p>Purumena Tutuan: The descendants of Purumena Tutuan were Gordon Sula, Maika Duke, Charles Lisi, Milton Wani, Jaguru and Yine from the first legitimate wife Maria Woro of Wandi clan.</p>
                <p>Bulson Bulli, Simon Ladu, Modong, Guo, and Augustino Wolyan from the second legitimate wife called Juan from Pojulu clan of Gaderu.</p>
                <p>And Taban Nelson as called Tongidyang, Suku, Dudu, Subek Nandera, Emmanuel Lo'du, Bongiri, Doru and Muggo from the third legitimate wife Poni Na Kei (the daughter of Kei). There were equally others born out wedlock.</p>
                <p>Morris Murye: the descendants of Morris Murye were Pita, Azaria Wolyan, Chaplain Soso also called Tongidyang, Simon Wolyan, Cecelia Yine, Joseph Loguli, Rejoice Poni, Julius Bongo, and Oliver Losuba also called Gwolo from his first legitimate wife Rebecca Kiden the daughter of WaniKonyi from the clan of Loringa- Bura.</p>
                <p>And Nora ‘Balai, Helda Suku, Rasulia Modong, Wanijo, Lucia Yanya, Isso also called Gire, Mama, Margret Yine, and Muggo from the second legitimate wife Christina ‘Diko from the clan of Wandi.</p>
                <p>Note: Abrama Mogga, Abele Kitenge, Petero Koboji, Bungu Wani, Purumena Tutuan and Morris Murye are the 5th known generational descendants of the clan of Jonyari/Malari</p>

            <h2>The Bail Out of Lupai</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>The Bail of Lupai</summary>
                <p>Traditionally, anyone brought up under the status quo described herein above are categorized as living outside his/her clan or family of origination. Unfortunately such a situation is sometimes associated with social shortcomings including loss of certain social rights and misfortunes that are real or perceived. To restore such subjects back to their clan or family of origination, certain traditional arrangements and accomplishments are often agreed and performed. This has been what was equally anticipated in the case of Lupai.</p>
                <p>Aware that Lupai was exiled at Korsak, and concerned by the social traits attached with it; the grandchildren of Lupai after consultations, sharing and dissemination of information did agree to mobilize resources both within and without in order to bail out Lupai.</p>
                <p>The bail of Lupai became reality on March 3rd 2012 when the stakeholders i.e. Jonyari. Korsak, Yibur, and the church who played the role of intermediary, gathered under a mango tree at Gaderu to discuss and resolve according to the customary requirements the matter pertinent to return of Lupai to his clan of origination.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Why Bail or Return of Lupai is Important?</summary>
                <p>The dream return of Lupai lingered to too long in any sound minded Jonyari basically due to a variety of reasons. Hence putting it on an action plan at our time is neither an act of wanton nor a show of prestige, but it is rather an accomplishment of social responsibility. The overall purpose of the bailout included but not limited to the list below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A fulfilment of social values and cultural practices</li>
                    <li>To resolve what is often deemed socially as a potential source of misfortune (real or perceived)</li>
                    <li>To appease the living spirits of the dead</li>
                    <li>To remove the negative social traits often attached with it.</li>
                </ol>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Occasion of the Bail or Return of Lupai</summary>
                <p>The occasion started on 3rd March 2012 with usual formalities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short prayers</li>
                    <li>Brief word of welcome by a family elder</li>
                    <li>Brief word of God: Reading Deuteronomy 36:35, then</li>
                    <li>An introduction of the theme and the purpose of the gathering which was already eluded into earlier, after which the session was then declared open.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Korsak who are the uncles of Lupai through their spokesperson chipped in and quarried:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Whom among the grandchildren of Lupai in particular came out with this initiative?</li>
                    <li>We want to know whether or not the idea was conceived as a result of consultation or advice of some witch doctors.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After satisfying their fears, illusions and assuring them about the overall purpose of the organization, their spokesperson then proceeded to present their shared views and concerns as Korsak on the theme:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The position of Korsak on the theme. We recognize that the clan of Korsak indeed took and hosted Lupai. While doing so, we neither intended to own him nor in anyway expressed desire to claim ownership. The Korsak simply took Lupai in reaction to the sense of loneliness Lupai would otherwise undergo after he had lost all his siblings. This statement negated other widely held views that Lupai was given to the Korsak because he had only single testis.</li>
                    <li>Proclamation of Yibur Identity. One of the sons of Lupai without mincing his words proclaimed that “we are Yibur “. He made the pronouncement while still under the patronage of Korsak. Such utterances not only disappointed prominent grandparents such as one called ‘Baka, but even many of the members of the clan of the Korsak. “We viewed such a proclamation as comprise of our socio-cultural values and practices which is not acceptable in our traditions”.</li>
                    <li>The Korsak were not happy too because Lupai in practices informally returned to his clan through backdoor i.e. he jumped over the fence. He contradicted by further refuting prior claims by some elements within Jonyari that Lupai indeed traditionally and ceremoniously returned. He lamented and cautioned, if yes, what exactly was done during the occasion and by whom?</li>
                    <li>The spokesperson concluded by expressing general disillusions and disappointments over some behavioral patterns of some elements of Jonyari. He cited heightened disregard, disrespect, greed, and selfishness as the characteristic behaviors among the grandchildren of Lupai.</li>
                </ol>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Reactions of Jonyari Toward the Korsak Presentations</summary>
                <p>The proclamations by some Jonyari elements within Jonyari that we are Yibur was not premeditated nor was it an official position of all or the clan of Jonyari. Yes we are Yibur by identity, but we also do respect our cultural norms and practices. In this case we do recognize that we are Yibur but traditionally under the patronage of Korsak until bailed out. This is why this function is organized today.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Presentations of Jonyari</summary>
                <p>Naturally when there are calamities in a family, it becomes ideal to revisit the past in order to secure the future. This is one of the reason and purpose of this get together. We organized this function to review the past with regard to the theme, identify the odds i.e. the wrongs, dids and did nots; accept or reject responsibilities and when necessary find mechanisms of cleansing.</p>
                <p>On this note, the spokesperson of Jonyari highlighted to the forum some of the general problems affecting the clan.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Persistent occurrence of calamities and misfortunates including deaths</li>
                    <li>Increase magnitude of minors and orphaned children and majority of who lacked parental guidance</li>
                    <li>Increase magnitude of socially unsettled sons and daughters of the clan especially at the diaspora</li>
                    <li>In spite of empirical human capital development in the clan; poverty alleviation has been contrastingly very insignificant to enhance socio-economic transformation of the people of the clan.</li>
                </ol>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Exercise of Intermarriage by the Two Clans of Jonyari and Korsak</summary>
                <p>Both clan members expressed dissatisfaction and shared concerns over incidences of intermarriage between the grandchildren of the two clans; a practice that threatens the essence of the relationship. The two sides after constructive deliberations agreed to put the practice to rest or hold and urged parents to guard against future incidences.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Brain Drain of Woti Lupai</summary>
                <p>In the past, when there was demand or request for human labor for civil works by government authorities, it was the children of the poor who were selected. Similarly, it was the children of the poor who were equally enrolled in school for fear of unknown outcome of such education. The rationale behind was that if anything bad happened, it would be the children of the poor who could bear the brunt. It was a strategy employed to safe guard the interest as well as the children of the elites.</p>
                <p>The family of Lupai was rated poor and fall within the categorization, hence they fall prey to the local administers. The poverty ridden family could not afford to raise the dowry or bride wealth for the sons to marry; besides, the family was not blessed with girls where bride wealth for most families was sourced. The effects of these factors combine enticed and/or drained Woti Lupai from rural to urban centers in search of treasure. This set precedence was neither a resultant curse nor a bad omen to cause any misfortunate or anything of that sort otherwise experienced today in the family.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Girl Child Education</summary>
                <p>During the occasion of the bail out of Lupai, the members of the clan sought clarification on some hearsay allegations that late Aunt Yari had say; let the education of the girls of Jonyari remain as hers because she was equally denied access to the same by her brothers. It is perceived that such wishful statement if authentic could be interpreted traditionally as a curse or wishful bad omen and could have a negative impact on the education of girls within the clan.</p>
                <p>In response, late aunt Yari did acknowledge that she had such illusions because she was indeed obstructed from school by her brothers. It happened that she was babysitting Sartiele Yama Wani and in the evening they go to school at Gaderu with Wilson Lodiong. Both of them were doing well and their teacher had recommended them to go to Romoggi approved school. Bungu stopped her on illusions that she would become a wasted girl when she is in school.</p>
                <p>Secondly, she wanted to go to Yei but Bungu and Purumena send Murye to stop her on reasons that some other guys (drivers) suspected to be her boyfriends would fight hence she was not allowed to travel to Yei. All these contributed to her not knowing any foreign language at all. These actions angered her but she had forgiven everything for the good of the girls of the clan.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>The Family of Late Wilson Lodiong</summary>
                <p>Old memories exacerbated by the presenting trend of things among some of the children of late Wilson Lodiong caused a mixture of anxiety, compassion and running tears among family members. They were particularly concerned because some of the children of Wilson remained socially unsettle and thus do not have families. The case of Lena, Lemi and even Larvina were particularly very disturbing although Larvina of late settled down and now bore a child. Secondly, family members were equally concerned apparently over growing sense of eroded social fabrics and weakened networking with some of the children. Such manifestations often disturb the mindset of many family members.</p>
                <p>The members of the family backtracked the family profile to find whether or not there were some wrongs, dids and dids not that might be the underlying factors behind the situation. In this context, two incidences were cited and referenced:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the issue is an incident involving a suicidal death of a maid at Wilson's home who allegedly committed suicide because the boyfriend declined to wed her. The matter was however reportedly resolved with the relatives of the deceased.</li>
                    <li>The other incident concerned is about Lena whereby she provoked some negative reactions from Mama Tabita Yobu. It happened when some consent was sought from the children of late Wilson on whether or not Mama Tabita deserved the rights of access to entitlement to the pension of late Wilson. Accordingly, Lena rejected outright the inclusion of Mama Tabita on the beneficiary list, saying all money be invested on their education.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On her part, Mama Tabita was extremely unhappy and responded by saying, “she (Lena) will remain like that wall”. The matter was resolved in a number of times, firstly before Mama Tabita died whereby they forgave each other. Secondly there was a follow up resolution of the same with the brother of Tabita Cde Eli whereby Lena herself provided some money to Eli to appease the anger of their sister at the level of their family. According to reports, Eli used the money on personal aspects and didn't gather their family on the subject. Thirdly, Sartiele also gave Eli some money so that they appease the anger of their sister as a family. In summary, the matter was timely realized and unless or otherwise brought to resolution.</p>
